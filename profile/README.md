# üíé Welcome to UVerify: Blockchain Made Easy

UVerify opens up blockchain technology to everyone, no matter your background. Effortlessly secure your file or text hashes on the Cardano blockchain. Want to kick the tires before diving into the code? Head over to [app.uverify.io](app.uverify.io) to check out the app.

## ‚ú® Features

With UVerify, you can easily store and retrieve data on the Cardano blockchain. The API is straightforward, and the UI is both intuitive and highly customizable. You can deploy your own instance or use the hosted version ‚Äî whatever fits your needs best. Our main goal is flexibility: UVerify is designed to be a tool anyone can integrate seamlessly into their own projects. It‚Äôs more than just a tool; it‚Äôs a platform.

### How does it work?

UVerify includes its own scoped chain indexer, a Web3 API key management system, on-chain metadata support, and extension points for both the backend and frontend. The frontend is built with React, while the backend is a Java Spring Boot application that leverages [Yaci Store](https://github.com/bloxbean/yaci-store).

## üöÄ Getting Started

It's all about verification, so why not run your own UVerify instance? Just grab this [docker-compose file](../scripts/docker-compose.yml) and fire off this command:

```zsh
docker compose up
```

### üçì Low Hanging Fruits

UVerify lets you build use cases in a snap. For most things, it feels more like calling an API than wrestling with a full-blown blockchain solution. Here are a few examples of what you can do with UVerify:

- **Notary Service:** Store file or text hashes on the Cardano blockchain.
```js
// UVerify plays nicely with any Cardano off-chain library. This example uses [meshjs.dev](https://meshjs.dev/apis/wallets)

// npm install @meshsdk/core

import { MeshWallet, KoiosProvider } from '@meshsdk/core';

const mnemonic = MeshWallet.brew();
const koiosProvider = new KoiosProvider('api');

const wallet = new MeshWallet({
    networkId: 1, // 0: testnet, 1: mainnet
    fetcher: koiosProvider,
    submitter: koiosProvider,
    key: {
        type: 'mnemonic',
        words: mnemonic,
    },
});

const userAddress = await wallet.getChangeAddress();

// backendUrl is for example api.uverify.io or localhost:9090

const response = await axios.post(
backendUrl + '/api/v1/transaction/build',
{
    type: 'DEFAULT',
    address: userAddress,
    certificates: [
    {
        hash: hash,
        metadata: metadata,
        algorithm: 'SHA-256',
    },
    ],
}
);

if (response.status === 200 && response.data.status?.code === 'SUCCESS') {
    const tx = response.data.unsigned_transaction;
    const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(tx, true);
    const result = await axios.post(
        backendUrl + '/api/v1/transaction/submit',
        {
            transaction: signedTx
        }
    );

    if (result.status === 200 && result.data.successful) {
        console.log('Transaction submitted successfully with txHash:', result.data.value);
    }

    /*
        You can also use a CIP30 browser api to sign the transaction. In this case, signTx would return a witnessSet instead of a signed transaction. You can then just submit the unsigned transaction and the witnessSet to the backend.

        const api = await (window as any).cardano[enabledWallet].enable();
        const witnessSet = await api.signTx(tx, true);

        const result = await axios.post(
          backendUrl + '/api/v1/transaction/submit',
          {
            transaction: tx,
            witnessSet: witnessSet,
          }
        );
    */
}
```

- **Custom UI Templates:** Make it your own with a tailored look and feel.

Use the `uverify_template_id` field to tweak the certificate's appearance. You can also chip in by adding new templates, or keep templates exclusive to your users by implementing the [abstract template](https://github.com/UVerify-io/uverify-ui/blob/main/src/templates/Template.tsx)

Here's a basic example for [student certificates](https://github.com/UVerify-io/uverify-ui/blob/main/src/templates/Diploma.tsx). For something more involved, check out the [social hub ui template](https://github.com/UVerify-io/uverify-ui/blob/main/src/templates/SocialHub/SocialHubTemplate.tsx).
